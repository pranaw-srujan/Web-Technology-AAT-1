      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every webpage.
        It is used to structure content using elements such as headings,
        paragraphs, images, links, lists, forms, and tables. Semantic HTML
        elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
        and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> improve readability and accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the presentation of HTML elements.
        It is responsible for layout, colors, fonts, spacing, responsiveness,
        and animations. CSS enables separation of content and design, making
        websites easier to maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern CSS features include Flexbox and Grid for layout, media queries
        for responsive design, transitions and animations for interactivity,
        and custom themes. In this project, CSS is used for dark themes,
        animated gradients, glow effects, hover effects, and smooth transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, HTML and CSS form the backbone of web development and are
        essential for creating clean, responsive, and visually appealing
        websites.

    <h5>Bootstrap Components</h5>

    <div id="bootstrap" class="collapse mt-3 text-secondary">
      <p>
        Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that helps developers build
        responsive websites quickly. It provides a grid system that adapts to
        different screen sizes such as mobiles, tablets, and desktops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bootstrap includes pre-designed components like navigation bars,
        buttons, cards, forms, modals, collapse panels, and alerts. These
        components reduce development time and ensure consistent UI design.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, Bootstrap is used for layout, cards, responsive grids,
        buttons, and collapse functionality. The collapse feature allows
        content to expand and collapse smoothly when users click buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bootstrap also supports utility classes for spacing, alignment,
        typography, and colors. Using Bootstrap ensures mobile-first design
        and improves usability across devices.

    <h5>Web Page Design & Animation</h5>
    <button class="btn btn-custom mt-2"
      data-bs-toggle="collapse"
      data-bs-target="#webpage">
<div class="text-white">

    </button>

    <div id="webpage" class="collapse mt-3 text-secondary">
      <p>
        Web page design focuses on creating visually appealing and user-friendly
        interfaces. A good design improves user engagement and makes content
        easier to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project uses a dark theme with animated gradients to create a
        modern and professional appearance. CSS keyframe animations are used
        to animate background colors smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hover effects on cards and images enhance interactivity. Gallery images
        transition from grayscale to color on hover, improving visual appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Animations are carefully used to enhance user experience without
        affecting performance. Proper spacing, alignment, and typography
        ensure readability and consistency across pages.
